# Audit: $ARGUMENTS

Find all occurrences of a code pattern in the codebase, review each for issues, and produce prioritized remediation recommendations.

> Use for cross-cutting concerns like auth checks, error handling, API patterns, or security vulnerabilities.

## Parse Arguments

| Argument | Default  | Description                          |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Pattern  | required | Code pattern to search for           |

**Examples:**
- `/audit console.log` — Find all console.log statements
- `/audit app.use(` — Find all middleware registrations
- `/audit fetch(` — Find all fetch calls
- `/audit try {` — Find all try-catch blocks

## Execution

This command invokes the `audit-pattern` workflow for multi-agent parallel execution.

### Workflow Execution

1. **Read the workflow:** `.opencode/workflows/audit-pattern.md`
2. **Execute all phases:**
   - Phase 1: Spawn 1 @explore agent to discover all occurrences
   - Phase 2: Spawn multiple @review agents (dynamic count based on occurrences)
   - Phase 3: Spawn 1 @general agent to synthesize findings
3. **Replace placeholders:**
   - `{pattern}` → the pattern from $ARGUMENTS
   - `{phase_N_output}` → actual output from completed phases
4. **Aggregate results** between phases
5. **Write final report** to `.opencode/artifacts/$(cat .opencode/artifacts/.active)/audit.md`

**Announce:** "Auditing codebase for pattern: [pattern]. Invoking audit-pattern workflow."

## Output

Report:

1. **Pattern:** [pattern searched]
2. **Occurrences found:** [count]
3. **Files affected:** [count]
4. **Issues by severity:**
   - Critical: [N]
   - Important: [N]
   - Minor: [N]
5. **Recommended fixes:** [list with file:line refs]
6. **Correct patterns:** [list of occurrences that are already correct]
